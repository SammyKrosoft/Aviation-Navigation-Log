# Why 1000 RPM ON STOP
 - 1,000 RPM typically keeps the engine warm, vacuum system working, and the alternator charging the electrical system.
 - Prevent lead building up on spark plugs when you are taxiing around (lead builds around if you leave engine below 1000rpm)


# MIXTURE CONTROL

> NOTE: fuel need air (oxygen) to burn. No air, no fire. The mix of fuel+air is lighten up in the pistons that make the propeller rotate.

What is Mixture:
 
- Controls the ratio of fuel to air going into your cylinders with the mixture knob
- This is important because the engine needs just the right ratio of fuel to air to produce the most power.
If there's too little or not enough fuel for the amount of air, the engine will run rougher and at a lower power.

> Rich mixtures - High Power Settings
> 
> Lean mixtures - Cruise Power Settings

Rich mixture = large amount of excess fuel is unburnt = cooler engine = good for take off where regime/motor  work is at max
Lean mixture = less amount of unburnt excess fuel = hoter engine.
Ideal mixture = complete burning of air/fuel mixture.

## MIXTURE CONTROL IN GENERAL

- Mixture control has the greatest effect on engine operating temperatures.

## HOW TO SET MIXTURE CONTROL IN FLIGHT

- Monitor the tachometer closely while moving mixture from rich to lean. 

  - An increase in RPM occurs at some point => 1st reach of maximum RPM = "rich best power"

  - Further leaning will hold max RPM for a while, then there is another point where RPM will start to drop => 2nd reach of maximum RPM = "lean best power"

> **NOTE**: re-check mixture with change of altitude, operating conditions



## FULL RICH ON TAKE OFF
At full takeoff power the aircraft engine requires a full rich mixture. The term "full rich" in this particular application describes a mixture as rich as possible without a substantial loss of power. Such a mixture does result in the loss of some power; however, the loss is slight and the added fuel flow greatly aids internal engine cooling at a time when the engine needs it most. Thus the power/cooling tradeoff is a good one.

## LEANING OUT THE MIXTURE

- Leaning out  the mixture means reducing the amount of fuel going from the fuel nozzle into the carburetor and the cylinders.

### LEANING OUT WHEN TAXIING

- Leaning out keeps the deposits off the plugs. Lean for taxi.
- Less fuel usage, faster warmup, cleaner plugs
- if leaning is done correctly, impossible to make takeoff power if mixture RICH is skipped prior to takeoff.
 
### LEANING OUT WHEN FLYING:

- Carburetors are calibrated for sea level operation (pressure 29.95, Temperature 25 degrees), meaning mixture full rich = correct fuel + air ratio.
- As (pressure) altitude increases, air pressure decreases, and the full rich mixture setting becomes too rich (too much fuel molecules in proportion of air molecules) => waste of fuel and loss of power. (range decrease, engine lifespan reduction)

- Leaning out the mixture is necessary to keep the correct fuel + air ratio as altitude increases.

#### Leaning at Cruise Power

> "lean best power"


#### Leaning at take off

- High manifold pressure : Mixture **Full rich**
- Take off / Landing at  any elevation < 5000 ft density altitude + climbing up to 5000ft, Mixture **full righ**
- High altitude airports (> 5000 ft density altitude), lean mixture for max p ower. Over rich = loss of power.

> "rich best power"

- to adjust  mixture to rich best power:
   - end of runway, lock brakes, full power, adjust mixture for rich best power.
 
 ## Adjusting mixture

Given mixture and throttle opening:
- Higher altitude => mixture becomes richer (too much fuel compared to air)
- Lower altitude => mixture becomes leaner (too much air compared to fuel)

- adjust every 1000 ft
 - adjust gradually richer during descend to not over-rich.

Reminder: richer mixture = cooler engine.

> NOTE: carb heat = hotter air = less dense air -> less air molecules => richer mixture -> need less fuel from nozzle => Lean a bit to reduce fuel and get better fuel:air ratio.


Leaner  mixture = fuel economy BUT risk of engine overheating of cylinder parts, engine failure
Richer mixture = loss of power, more fuel waste BUT less risk of engine failure as richer mixture = cooler engine

- Engine working with "lean mixture" too often wear faster.
- Long run : better using little more fuel during running time between overhaul than pay extra overhaul costs.

## CONCLUSION

Proper leaning =

- Economy of fuel
- Smoother running engine
Too rich mixture makes engine running rough, cause vibrations, bad for engine mounts and accessories
- more efficient engine, higher airspeeds,  better performance
- Extended range of airplane at cruise
- Less spark plug fouling and longer life of spark plugs
- Better engine temperature
- Cleaner combustion chambers and  less pre-ignition from deposits

# Why to we check MIXTURE RICH 3 times 

*(Rich below 3000ft as per POH)*

- one time on RUNUP
- one time before flight
- one time on taking of check (Flaps - Mixture - gauges)
