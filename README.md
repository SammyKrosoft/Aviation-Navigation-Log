# Aviation Navigation Log
Excel  workbook to help planning a cross country flight. Fill the True Course (TC), Wind Direction (Wd), Wind speed (Ws), True Air Speed (TAS), Magnetic Variation (VAR), Compass Magnetic Deviation (DEV), Distance, and it will calculate the Wind Correction Angle (WCA), True Heading (TH), Compass Heading (CH), Ground Speed (GS), Fuel consumption, Fuel remaining, Estimated Time Enroute (ETE) and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).

# This Workbook has several tabs: 
- one that explains the formulas to calculate the WCA
- one that you fill (TC, Wd, Ws, TAS, VAR, DEV, Dist) and it calculates the above values (WCA, TH, CH, GS,ETE, ETA,...)
- one that you fill as well, same as above, but I moved the checkpoints names so that you can fold and use the relevant part it in flight (the part that shows the CH, Dist, GS, ETE, ETA, Fuel consumed, Fuel remainig
- one that enables you to calculate and illustrates the cross-winds

Showing only the Nav Log (Foldable) here as the Nav Log (non foldable) is exactly the same in a different disposition (checkpoint names on the first column instead of in the middle-right)
