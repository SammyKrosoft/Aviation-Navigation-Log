# Aviation Navigation Log
Excel  workbook to help planning a cross country flight. Fill the True Course (TC), Wind Direction (Wd), Wind speed (Ws), True Air Speed (TAS), Magnetic Variation (VAR), Compass Magnetic Deviation (DEV), Distance, and it will calculate the Wind Correction Angle (WCA), True Heading (TH), Compass Heading (CH), Ground Speed (GS), Fuel consumption, Fuel remaining, Estimated Time Enroute (ETE) and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).

# This Workbook has several tabs: 
- **Formulas**: explains the formulas to calculate the WCA
- **Nav Log (non foldable)**: you fill (TC, Wd, Ws, TAS, VAR, DEV, Dist) and it calculates the above values (WCA, TH, CH, GS,ETE, ETA,...). If you fold it, you won't be able to see the checkpoint names and the CH/GS/ETE/ETA/Fuel info
- **Nav Log (Foldable)**: same as above, but I moved the checkpoints names column so that you can fold and use the relevant part of your Nav Log  in flight (the part that shows the CH, Dist, GS, ETE, ETA, Fuel consumed, Fuel remainig. Indeed the TC, Wd, Ws, TAS, VAR and DEV are of no use while flying through your navigation checkpoints; only the CH, GS, ETE, ETA and Fuel information are the metrics you check (and correct with the actual values) in flight.
- **Cross Wind Calculator**: illustrates and calculate the cross-winds; Along with the calculation of the cross-wind/head-wind components, I put there 2 compass-style schemas: one with the plane and wind headings, and one with the runway orientation and wind heading

# Screenshots

Showing only the **Nav Log (Foldable)** here as the **Nav Log (non foldable)** is exactly the same in a different disposition (checkpoint names is on the first column instead of in the middle-right)
