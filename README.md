# Aviation Navigation Log
Excel  workbook to help planning a cross country flight. Fill the True Course (TC), Wind Direction (Wd), Wind speed (Ws), True Air Speed (TAS), Magnetic Variation (VAR), Compass Magnetic Deviation (DEV), Distance, and it will calculate the Wind Correction Angle (WCA), True Heading (TH), Compass Heading (CH), Ground Speed (GS), Fuel consumption, Fuel remaining, Estimated Time Enroute (ETE) and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).

# This Workbook has several tabs: 
- one that explains the formulas to calculate the WCA
- one that you fill (TC, Wd, Ws, TAS, VAR, DEV, Dist) and it calculates the above values (WCA, TH, CH, GS,ETE, ETA,...)
- one that is the same as above, but that you can fold and use it in flight
- one that enables you to calculate and illustrates the cross-winds
